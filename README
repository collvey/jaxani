#  Accurate Neural Network Potential on JAX

JaxANI is a JAX implementation migrated from [TorchANI](https://github.com/aiqm/torchani). It supports energy calculation from atom species and coordinates using imported ANI models.

# Demo

JaxANI molecule energy calculation demo is shown in this Colab [demo](https://github.com/collvey/jaxani/blob/main/Jaxani_Energy_Calculation_Validation_Demo.ipynb)

# ANI model parameters
All the ANI model parameters including (ANI2x, ANI1x, and ANI1ccx) are accessible from the following repositories:
- [isayev/ASE_ANI](https://github.com/isayev/ASE_ANI)
- [aiqm/ani-model-zoo](https://github.com/aiqm/ani-model-zoo)
